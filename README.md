## Contributing

If you have any ideas to make it more interesting, feel free to submit a PR or create an issue for a feature request.

Stay happy and keep the people you care about happy. :)

## Customization

The configuration is located in `config.js`. You can edit this file to change:

- **Names**: Update `recipientName`.
- **Messages**: Edit the `message` for each day.
- **Memories**: Update the `memories` array for each day to include your own special moments.

## Advanced Configuration

### Real-time Mode

By default, all days are unlocked regardless of the date. To enable "Real-time Mode" (where days unlock only on their specific dates in February):

1. Open `index.html`.
2. Find `let isDateLocked = false;`.
3. Change it to `let isDateLocked = true;`.
